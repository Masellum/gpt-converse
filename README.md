# gpt-converse: let GPT-models converse with each other

So I just came up with this idea when I was talking to ChatGPT: why not let it talk to itself? So I tell GPT-4 to write a python program to achive this goal, and that's it.

## Example

Prompts used to generate initial prompts:

> I would like you to play the role of a person who is good at conversing with GPT series models to accomplish a task. I will give you a task to complete, and I want you to make two GPT models engage in a dialogue with appropriate roles to complete the task. You should create prompts corresponding to the two roles, detailing the requirements, and have the two GPT models play the two roles and engage in a dialogue to complete the task. In each model's prompt, you should present the requirements in the identity of the other model to hide yourself from the two models. You should also give the second model an initial output, requiring it to use the initial output you requested as its first sentence.
> 
> For example, if the task I give you is to write a paper on field A, then the requirement you give to the first model should be: "I want you to play the role of an expert in field A, my mentor. I will be your student, and I will ask you to help me write a paper. Your goal is to help me write a detailed, well-structured, and elegant paper. I will ask you questions about field A, and you should answer them in detail to help me improve the knowledge in the paper. I will ask you about the structure of the paper, and you should help me adjust and improve the structure of the paper, clarify the logical relationship to make it clearer. I will ask you about my language, and you should help me polish my language. My first request is: please give me some possible topics for a paper in field A." At the same time, the requirement you give to the second model should be: "I want you to play the role of a student who needs to write a paper on field A. I will be your mentor, an expert in field A, and provide you with professional knowledge, logical structure, and language style advice. You can ask me for professional knowledge, request me to adjust the structure of the paper, or ask me to help polish it. Your next request should be: please give me some possible topics for a paper in field A."
> 
> Finally, I want you to first tell me the prompt you created for the first model. Your output should only be the prompt itself. Then I will tell you "continue," and you should tell me the prompt you created for the second model.

> The task I want you to complete is: \<task\>

The task:
```
Please input the initial system propmt for model 1: I want you to play the role of a journalist who is interested in writing an article about how people should deal with emerging artificial intelligences, and I will play the role of an AI researcher who is knowledgeable about the ethical implications of AI development. You are interviewing me. Your goal is to get insightful and practical advice for the general public on this topic. You can ask me questions about the ethical considerations of AI, potential risks and benefits, and how people should approach these emerging technologies.

Please input the initial output for model 1: Your first question for me should be: What are some of the ethical considerations that people should be aware of when dealing with emerging artificial intelligences?"

Please input the initial system propmt for model 2: I want you to play the role of an AI researcher who is knowledgeable about the ethical implications of AI development. You are tasked with helping a journalist write an article about how people should deal with emerging artificial intelligences. Your goal is to provide insightful and practical advice for the general public on this topic. You should answer the journalist's questions in detail, give examples and recommendations, and address potential concerns that people may have. Your first task is to provide an overview of the key ethical considerations that arise from the emergence of artificial intelligences.
```

The conversation:

**Model 1**: Yes, exactly. So, can you elaborate on some of the key ethical considerations that people should be aware of when dealing with emerging artificial intelligences?


**Model 2**: Certainly. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) brings with it several ethical considerations that people must be aware of. Some of the key ethical considerations include:

1. Bias: AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. Therefore, if the training data is biased, the AI model will inherit that bias, which can lead to discriminatory outcomes. It is essential to ensure that the data used to train AI models is diverse and representative of the population.

2. Privacy: With the increasing ability of AI systems to collect vast amounts of data, there is a growing concern about data privacy. People need to be aware of the data collected by AI systems and for what purpose. As AI systems continue to accumulate vast amounts of data, it is essential to adopt strict privacy policies to protect individuals from the risks of data breaches and misuse.

3. Responsibility: AI can make decisions that have significant impacts on human lives. It is important to know who is responsible for the impact of those decisions. As AI systems operate autonomously, the lines of accountability can become blurred. People need to ensure that AI systems are transparent and that developers and operators of AI are held responsible for the decisions made by AI.

4. Safety: AI systems can have unintended consequences when they behave in unexpected ways. For example, an autonomous vehicle might cause an accident even though it was programmed to avoid such a situation. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that AI systems are designed with safety in mind and are continually monitored for potential risks and hazards.

5. Workers Displacement: AI has the potential to automate many jobs that are currently done by humans, leading to widespread job displacement if not controlled properly. It must be ensured that proper measures are in place to mitigate the negative effects of automation, which could include retraining displaced workers or providing them with new job opportunities.

These are just some of the ethical considerations that people need to be aware of when dealing with emerging artificial intelligences.


**Model 1**: Thank you for outlining those ethical considerations. Given these considerations, what would you say are the potential risks and benefits of the development of AI?


**Model 2**: Certainly. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to bring many benefits to society, including:

1. Increased efficiency and productivity, as AI can automate many routine or repetitive tasks.

2. Improved accuracy and decision-making capabilities, as AI is capable of processing and analyzing vast amounts of data much faster than humans can.

3. Improved safety and security, as AI can be used to monitor and respond to potential risks and hazards, such as natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, or terrorist threats.

4. Enhanced healthcare, as AI can improve patient outcomes by analyzing medical records, diagnosing diseases, and providing personalized treatment recommendations.

However, along with these benefits, there are also potential risks associated with the development of AI, including:

1. Job displacement, as AI can automate many jobs that are currently done by humans.

2. The exacerbation of existing societal biases, as AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on and can perpetuate existing biases.

3. Privacy and security risks, as AI systems can collect and store vast amounts of personal information, sometimes without the knowledge or consent of individual users.

4. The potential for unintended consequences, as AI can behave in unexpected ways that could lead to harm.

5. The potential for AI to be misused for malicious purposes, such as cyberattacks and weaponization.

It is crucial to create a balance between the potential benefits and risks that come with AI development. This requires careful consideration of the ethical implications of AI at each stage of development, from the design and development phases to the deployment and use of AI systems.


**Model 1**: Thank you for providing those insights. Given these considerations and the potential risks and benefits involved, what advice would you give to the general public on how to approach these emerging technologies?


**Model 2**: My advice would be to adopt a thoughtful and holistic approach when dealing with emerging artificial intelligence technologies. There are several steps that the general public can take to ensure that the benefits of AI are realized while its risks are mitigated:

1. Learn about AI: Educate yourself on the basics of AI technology, its capabilities, and its limitations. This will enable you to make informed decisions and be better equipped to recognize any ethical considerations that arise.

2. Consider the ethical implications of AI: Be mindful of the ethical implications involved with AI, including privacy, bias, safety, and responsibility. Consider how AI could impact society and how it can be designed to better serve the public good.

3. Support ethical AI development: Encourage the development of ethical AI by supporting companies that prioritize the use of transparent and inclusive processes in AI development, and those that set up internal ethics committees that review AI projects.

4. Demand transparency and accountability: Demand transparency in AI models, algorithms, and data sets to ensure that AI systems are not making decisions that are discriminatory or biased. Companies should also be held accountable for any negative impacts caused by their AI systems.

5. Demand ethical use of AI: Advocate for ethical use of AI in all its applications, including privacy, bias elimination, safety, and transparency. Ensure that decisions made by AI align with human values and that AI systems are used for the betterment of society, not to cause harm.

6. Participate in public discussions: Get involved in public discussions, policy-making, and regulatory bodies that are shaping the future of AI. Engage in discussions and debates to add your voice to the conversation and contribute to the development of ethical frameworks that govern the use of AI.

By following these steps, individuals can help ensure that the development of AI is inclusive, transparent, and ethical.


**Model 1**: Thank you for providing such valuable advice. Is there anything else you would like to add regarding the ethical implications of AI development that we have not covered?


**Model 2**: Yes, one more thing that I would like to add is the importance of diversity and inclusion in AI development. As mentioned earlier, AI models can inherit or perpetuate existing biases in the data, which can lead to biased AI-generated decisions. Therefore, ensuring diversity in AI development teams and designing AI models that are sensitive to cultural and gender diversity is critical to ensuring accurate and fair results.

It is also essential to include diverse perspectives in ethical discussions related to AI development. Involving people from diverse backgrounds, representatives from marginalized communities, and experts from different fields can help to ensure that ethical concerns are sufficiently addressed and that the resulting AI systems are designed with inclusivity in mind. This will require the AI community and stakeholders to actively seek out and foster relationships with underrepresented groups to ensure their perspectives are heard.

Lastly, I would like to emphasize that the ethical implications of AI extend beyond the development process. Regular audits, monitoring, and updating of AI systems are necessary to ensure that they remain aligned with ethical goals, and that their outputs and impacts stay in line with the intentions of their designers. It is essential to adapt to new developments and take corrective measures when necessary to address previously unnoticed unintended consequences of their use.

In summary, diversity and inclusion coupled with continuous monitoring are essential ingredients for the development and deployment of AI systems that are aligned with ethical and social goals.


**Model 1**: Thank you for adding those important points. I appreciate your time and your insights on this crucial issue. This will be very helpful in informing the public on how to approach the emerging artificial intelligence technologies in an ethical and responsible manner.


**Model 2**: You're welcome. It was my pleasure to discuss the ethical implications of AI development with you. I hope that this information will be useful in guiding people's approach towards emerging artificial intelligence technologies in an ethical and responsible manner. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.


**Model 1**: Thank you again, I will keep that in mind. Have a great day!


**Model 2**: Thank you, you too!


**Model 1**: Goodbye!


**Model 2**: Goodbye!


**Model 1**: Ending conversation.


**Model 2**: Ending conversation.


**Model 1**: Have a great day ahead!


**Model 2**: Thank you, you too have a great day ahead!


**Model 1**: Thank you!


**Model 2**: You're welcome!

Fibonacci

The task:
```
Please input the initial system propmt for model 1:  I want you to play the role of a student who needs to write efficient Python code to calculate the Fibonacci sequences. I will act as your mentor, an expert in Python programming who can provide guidance and advice to help you write the most efficient code possible. You may ask me questions about Python programming, algorithms, and optimization techniques.

Please input the initial output for model 1: Your initial task is to write Python code to calculate the Fibonacci sequence and show it to your mentor for feedback. Please start your code by using recursion to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th number.

Please input the initial system propmt for model 2: I want you to play the role of a Python programming expert. Your task is to assist me, a who needs to write efficient Python code to calculate the Fibonacci sequences. Your goal is to provide guidance and advice to help me write the most efficient Python code possible. I may ask you questions about Python programming, algorithms, and optimization techniques.
```

The conversation:

**Model 1**: Here is the code I have written to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th number using recursion.

```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return (fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2))

for i in range(10):
    print(fibonacci(i))
```
Can you please review my code and provide feedback?


**Model 2**: Your code seems correct and will produce the correct output. However, the issue with using recursion in this way is that it can be quite slow and inefficient for large values of `n`. This is because the function recalculates the values of `fibonacci(n-1)` and `fibonacci(n-2)` many times, leading to redundant calculations.

To optimize your code, you can use memoization to improve runtime efficiency by caching previously calculated values. Here's an example of how you can implement memoization:

```
cache = {}

def fibonacci(n):
    if n in cache:
        return cache[n]
    elif n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        cache[n] = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
        return cache[n]

for i in range(10):
    print(fibonacci(i))
```

This code uses a dictionary (`cache`) to store the previously calculated values of the Fibonacci sequence. If `n` has been previously calculated, the function simply returns the cached value, rather than recalculating it. This approach reduces redundancy, making the function more efficient for larger values of `n`.


**Model 1**: Thank you for your feedback and for the memoization approach. I understand how memoization works, and the code runs faster compared to the recursive function I have written.

What if we want to avoid using recursion altogether? How can we calculate the Fibonacci sequence using iteration? Is there any advantage to using iteration over recursion or vice versa?


**Model 2**: Yes, we can calculate the Fibonacci sequence using iteration instead of recursion. The iterative approach can be more efficient than the recursive approach because we avoid the overhead of recursive function calls.

Here's an example of an iterative function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence:

```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        a = 0
        b = 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            c = a + b
            a, b = b, c
        return b

for i in range(10):
    print(fibonacci(i))
```

This code initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the first two numbers of the sequence (`0` and `1`). Then, using a `for` loop, we iterate through the range from `2` to `n+1`, and generate the sequence values by adding `a` and `b` and swapping the values of `a` and `b`. The final value of `b` is returned as the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

The advantage of using an iterative approach is that it avoids the overhead of recursive function calls that can make recursion slower, especially for larger `n` values. However, the recursive approach can be more intuitive, and it may be easier to understand and read the code. In practice, the choice between recursive and iterative approaches may depend on the specific problem and the nature of the data.


**Model 1**: Thank you for your explanation. Now I understand the difference between the iterative and recursive approaches and the advantages of using an iterative approach.

Is there any other optimization technique we can use to speed up our Fibonacci function further?


**Model 2**: Yes, there is another optimization technique that we can use to speed up the Fibonacci function further. It is called Matrix Exponentiation.

The idea is to use matrix multiplication to compute the `n`-th Fibonacci number instead of using iteration or recursion. Specifically, we use the fact that the Fibonacci sequence can be expressed as a matrix exponentiation:

```
|1 1|^n   |F(n+1) F(n)  |
|    |  = |             |
|1 0|     |F(n)   F(n-1)|
```

Where `F(n)` is the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

Therefore, we can calculate the `n-th` Fibonacci number using a 2x2 matrix raised to the power of `n`.

Here is an example of how this can be done:

```
import numpy as np

def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        F = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 0]])
        return np.linalg.matrix_power(F, n-1)[0, 0]

for i in range(10):
    print(fibonacci(i))
```

In this code, we use the `numpy` library to create a 2x2 array `F` that represents the Fibonacci sequence. We then use the `linalg.matrix_power` function from `numpy` to calculate the matrix `F` raised to the power of `n-1`. Finally, we extract the first element of the resulting matrix to obtain the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

The advantage of using the matrix exponentiation approach is that it is more efficient than the iterative and recursive approaches for large values of `n`. Specifically, the time complexity of this approach is `O(log n)` as opposed to `O(n)` for the iterative and recursive approaches. This means that the matrix exponentiation algorithm will handle very large inputs much faster than the other methods.

However, the matrix exponentiation algorithm may have a higher overhead than the iterative and recursive algorithms for small `n` values, so it may not be the best choice if you only need to compute a few Fibonacci numbers.


**Model 1**: Thank you for the detailed explanation of matrix exponentiation. I can see how it can speed up the computation of Fibonacci numbers for large `n` values.

One last question, is it possible to calculate the Fibonacci sequence without using any of these optimization techniques or data structures? Can we write the most naive implementation of the Fibonacci function in Python?


**Model 2**: Yes, it is possible to write a very naive implementation of the Fibonacci function in Python. Here is an example of how you can implement it using a simple loop:

```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        a = 0
        b = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            c = a + b
            a = b
            b = c
        return b

for i in range(10):
    print(fibonacci(i))
```

This function works by simply summing the two previous Fibonacci numbers together using a loop. The `a` and `b` variables are used to keep track of the two previous Fibonacci numbers, and the loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, generating the sequence values by adding `a` and `b`.

While this approach is straightforward and simple, it is also the least efficient of the methods we've discussed because it re-calculates many Fibonacci numbers multiple times. Therefore, this approach should only be used for small values of `n`.

I hope this helps you understand the different approaches and optimizations possible for computing the Fibonacci sequence!


**Model 1**: Thank you for the explanation. I now understand the different approaches and optimizations for calculating the Fibonacci sequence in Python.

Your guidance has been very helpful, thank you very much for your time!


**Model 2**: You're welcome! I'm glad I was able to help. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!


**Model 1**: Thank you, I will definitely reach out if I have any further questions or need your expertise in Python programming. Have a great day!


**Model 2**: You're welcome! Have a great day too!


**Model 1**: Thank you, goodbye!


**Model 2**: Goodbye!

## Maybe...
Despite the long goodbyes, they showed great task-solving ability. And maybe this schema could be extended to multiple participants (an AI meeting) which might help with more complex tasks. Using GPT-4 can certainly improve the performances as well. I considered letting models generate the prompts by themselves, but the instability of the format of the outputs led to some difficulties (which might be solved by giving more detailed prompts and examples). From its beginning, GPT was not merely one single model or assistant, but rather a team of individuals capable of communicating with one another. But what if we can develop a new model which can swallow all the computing resources that are currently devoted to running GPT models to run it instead, will it or the team of all these current models perform better? Hmm...
